    CaptionAsset:
      description: |
        The CaptionAsset is used to add captions (subtitles) to a video. It uses a supplied SRT or VTT file which will
        be read and burnt to the video.
        
        Captions can be applied independently from a video or audio file for greater
        flexibility with styling and layout. For example you can scale, position or crop a video without modifying the
        captions.
        
        To sync captions with a video or audio file use a [Video](#tocs_videoasset") or [Audio](#tocs_audioasset") with
        matching start and end time.

        trim:
          description: >-
            The start trim point of the captions, in seconds (defaults to 0). Remove the trim length from teh start of
            the captions and allow it to be synced with video or audio. The captions will play until the file ends or
            the Clip length is reached.

        speed:
          description: >-
            Adjust the playback speed of the captions between 0 (paused) and 10 (10x normal speed) where 1 is normal
            speed (defaults to 1). Adjusting the speed will also adjust the duration of the clip and may require you to 
            adjust the Clip length. For example, if you set speed to 0.5, the clip will need to be 2x as long to play
            the entire captions (i.e. original length / 0.5). If you set speed to 2, the clip will need to be half as long
            to play the entire captions (i.e. original length / 2).
