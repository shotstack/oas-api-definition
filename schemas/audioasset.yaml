    AudioAsset:
      description: >-
        The AudioAsset is used to add sound effects and audio at specific intervals on
        the timeline. The src must be a publicly accessible URL to an audio resource such 
        as an mp3 file.

        trim:
          description: >-
            The start trim point of the audio clip, in seconds (defaults to 0). Audio
            will start from the in trim point. The audio will play until the
            file ends or the Clip length is reached.

        volume:
          description: >-
            Set the volume of the audio clip. Use a number or an array of [Tween](./#tocs_tween) objects to create
            custom volume transitions.
          oneOf:
            - type: number
              description: >-
                The volume level for the audio clip. Range varies from 0 to 1 where 0 is muted and 1 is full volume
                (defaults to 1).

            - type: array
              description: >-
                An array of [Tween](./#tocs_tween) objects used to create a custom volume effect. Modify the volume
                of an asset over time.

        speed:
          description: >-
            Adjust the playback speed of the audio clip between 0 (paused) and 10 (10x normal speed), where 1 is normal
            speed (defaults to 1). Adjusting the speed will also adjust the duration of the clip and may require you to 
            adjust the Clip length. For example, if you set speed to 0.5, the clip will need to be 2x as long to play
            the entire audio (i.e. original length / 0.5). If you set speed to 2, the clip will need to be half as long
            to play the entire audio (i.e. original length / 2).
