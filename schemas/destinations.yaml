      description: >-
        A destination is a location where assets can be sent to for serving or hosting. Videos, images and audio files
        that are rendered by the Edit API and source and rendition files generated by the Ingest API can be sent to 
        destinations. A file can be sent to one or more destinations including 3rd party destinations.


        By default all ingested and generated assets are automatically sent to the 
        [Shotstack hosting destination](https://shotstack.io/docs/guide/serving-assets/hosting). You can 
        [opt-out](https://shotstack.io/docs/guide/serving-assets/self-host) from by setting the Shotstack destination
         **exclude** property to **true**.


        The following destinations are available:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#tocs_shotstackdestination">ShotstackDestination</a></li>
          <li><a href="#tocs_muxdestination">MuxDestination</a></li>
          <li><a href="#tocs_s3destination">S3Destination</a></li>
        </ul>
