            Offset an asset on the horizontal axis (left or right). Use a number or an array of
            [Tween](./#tocs_tween) objects to create a custom animation.

                Range varies from -10 to 10. Positive numbers move the asset right, negative left.
                The distance moved is relative to the width  of the viewport - i.e. an X offset of 0.5 will move the
                asset half the screen width to the right.

                An array of [Tween](./#tocs_tween) objects used to create a custom animation. Animate the X offset
