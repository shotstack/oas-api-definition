    CaptionAsset:
      description: |
        The CaptionAsset is used to add captions (subtitles) to a video. It uses a supplied SRT or VTT file which will
        be read and burnt to the video.
        
        Captions can be applied independently from a video or audio file for greater
        flexibility with styling and layout. For example you can scale, position or crop a video without modifying the
        captions.
        
        To sync captions with a video or audio file use a [Video](#tocs_videoasset") or [Audio](#tocs_audioasset") with
        matching start and end time.
