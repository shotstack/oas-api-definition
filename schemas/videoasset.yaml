        trim:
          description: >-
            The start trim point of the video clip, in seconds (defaults to 0). Videos
            will start from the in trim point. The video will play until the

        volume:
          description: >-
            Set the volume for the video clip between 0 and 1 where 0 is muted and 1
            is full volume (defaults to 1).

        speed:
          description: >-
            Adjust the playback speed of the video clip between 0 (paused) and 10 (10x normal speed) where 1 is normal
            speed (defaults to 1). Adjusting the speed will also adjust the duration of the clip and may require you to 
            adjust the Clip length. For example, if you set speed to 0.5, the clip will need to be 2x as long to play
            the entire video (i.e. original length / 0.5). If you set speed to 2, the clip will need to be half as long
            to play the entire video (i.e. original length / 2).
