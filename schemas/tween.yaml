      description: >-
        Use a Tween to [animate properties over time](/docs/guide/architecting-an-application/animations/). The
        following properties are currently supported and can be animated:
          <ul>
            <li>Opacity - animate the transparency of a clip.</li>
            <li>Offset - animate the x and y position of a clip.</li>
            <li>Rotation - animate the rotation of a clip.</li>
            <li>Skew - animate the horizontal and vertical shearing effect.</li>
            <li>Volume - animate the audio volume of a clip.</li>
          </ul>
      properties:
        from:
          description: >-
            The initial property value at the start of the animation.
          example: 0
        to:
          description: >-
            The final property value at the end of the animation.
          example: 1
        start:
          description: >-
            The time in seconds when the animation starts, relative to the clip, not the timeline.
          type: number
          example: 0
        length:
          description: >-
            The duration of the animation in seconds.
          type: number
          example: 3
        interpolation:
          description: >-
            The interpolation method to use for the animation. Available options are:
            <ul>
              <li>`linear` - a linear interpolation between the start and end values.</li>
              <li>`bezier` - a bezier curve interpolation between the start and end values.</li>
            </ul>
          type: string
          example: bezier
          enum:
            - linear
            - bezier
