      description: >-
        A destination is a location where assets can be sent to for serving or hosting. Videos, images and audio files that
        are rendered by the [Edit API](#shotstack-edit) and [source](#tocs_source) and [rendition](#tocs_rendition) files
        generated by the [Ingest API](#shotstack-ingest) can be sent to destinations. You can also fetch a file from any
        public URL and [transfer](#transfer-asset) it to a destination. A file can be sent to one or more destinations
        including 3rd party destinations.


        By default all ingested and generated assets are automatically sent to the [Shotstack hosting
        destination](https://shotstack.io/docs/guide/serving-assets/hosting/). You can
        [opt-out](https://shotstack.io/docs/guide/serving-assets/self-host/) from by setting the Shotstack destination
        **exclude** property to **true**.
