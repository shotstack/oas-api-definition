    SkewTransformation:
      description: >-
        Skew a clip so its edges are sheared at an angle. Use values between 0 and 3.
        Over 3 the clip will be skewed almost flat.

                Range varies from 0 to 3. Positive numbers skew the asset right, negative left.
                The distance moved is relative to the width of the viewport - i.e. an X skew of 0.5 will skew the
                asset half the screen width to the right.
              format: float
              example: 0.5
