          type: string
          example: "#00b140"
        threshold:
          description: >-
            Pixels within this distance from the key color are eliminated by setting their alpha values to zero.
          type: integer
          minimum: 0
          maximum: 250
          example: 150
        halo:
          description: >-
            Pixels within the halo distance from the threshold boundary are given an increasing alpha value based on
            their distance from the threshold.
          type: integer
          minimum: 0
          maximum: 250
          example: 100
