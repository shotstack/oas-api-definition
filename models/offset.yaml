            Offset an asset on the horizontal axis (left or right), range varies
            from -10 to 10. Positive numbers move the asset right, negative left.
            For all assets except titles the distance moved is relative to the width 
            of the viewport - i.e. an X offset of 0.5 will move the asset half the 
            screen width to the right.

            -10 to 10. Positive numbers move the asset up, negative down.
            For all assets except titles the distance moved is relative to the height 
            of the viewport - i.e. an Y offset of 0.5 will move the asset up half the 
            screen height.
