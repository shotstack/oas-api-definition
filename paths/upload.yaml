        Request a signed URL to upload a file to. Use the signed URL to send a PUT request with the binary file. Using 
        Curl you can use a command like:
            
        `curl -X PUT -T video.mp4 {data.attributes.url}`
            
        Where **data.attributes.url** is the signed URL returned in the response.
