        Request a signed URL to upload a file to. Use the signed URL to send a PUT request with the binary file. Using 
        cURL you can use a command like:
            
        `curl -X PUT -T video.mp4 {data.attributes.url}`
            
        Where **video.mp4** is the file you want to upload and **{data.attributes.url}** is the signed URL returned in the
        response.
