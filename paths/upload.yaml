        Request a signed URL to upload a file to. The response returns a signed URL that you use to upload the file to.
        The signed URL looks similar to:
        
        https://shotstack-ingest-api-stage-sources.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/5ca6hu7s9k/zzytey4v-32km-kq1z-aftr-3kcuqi0brad2/source?AWSAccessKeyId=ASIAWJV7UWDMGTZLHTXP&Expires=1677209777&Signature=PKR4dGDDdOuMTAQmDASzLGmLOeo%3D&x-amz-acl=public-read&x-amz-security-token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEGMaDmFwLX......56osBGByztm7WZdbmXzO09KR

        In a separate API call, use this signed URL to send a PUT request with the binary file. Using  cURL you can use
        a command like:
            
        `curl -X PUT -T video.mp4 {data.attributes.url}`
            
        Where **video.mp4** is the file you want to upload and **{data.attributes.url}** is the signed URL returned in
        the response. The request must be a PUT type.

        The SDK does not currently support the PUT request. You can use the SDK to make the request for the signed URL
        and then use cURL to make the PUT request.
